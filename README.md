Scope: Define feature BDD steps for th following scenario.
 --> As a user I want to verify that the city Frankfurt is in Germany and return their corresponded latitude and longitude.

Environment used:
 Java version: 11 
 IDE :         Intellije
 
 Structure:
 BaseUtils: I have described the frequenty used methods here.
 Global Properties :It is a properties file where URL and other commonly used strings can be given.
 BDD :And defined general BDD structure
 Feature,
 Step Definitions and 
 TestRunner.
 POM files had all the dependecies required.

 So when we run the file from test runner or feature file logs are stored in logging.txt file (framwork is designed in this way in baseUtils)
 In the console report is generated and can use link by copying and pasting in browser to see the results.
